    <h1><b><u>NATURE</u></b></h1>
 <h2><u>What is Nature?</u></h2>
 <p><b>Nature</b>,in the brodest sense, is equivalent to the <b>natural physical world,</b>"Nature" refers to the phenomina of the physical world, and also to life in general. It ranges in scale from the subatomic to the cosmic.</p>
 <p2>The term <b>"nature"</b>may refer to living plants and animal, geology process, weather,and phusics, such as matter and energy. The term is often refer to the "natural environment" or wilderness--wild animals,rocks,faorst,beaches,and in general areas that have not been substantially altered by humans, or which persist despite human intervent. For, example ,<b>"human nature"</b>or <b>"the whole of nature".</b>This more traditional concept of <b>"nature"</b>implies a distinction between natural and artificial element of the earth, with the artifical as that which has been brought into being by human conscicousness or a human mind.</p2>

    <h3><u>1. Etymology</u></h3>
    <p>The word <b>nature</b>is derived from the Latin word <b>natura,</b>or "essential qualities,innate disposition", and literally means "birth". Natura was a latin translation of the greek word physics, which correlated plants,animals,and other features of the world as developing of their own accord. The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core application of the word by pre-Socratic philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. </p>
    <h3><u>2. Earth</u></h3>
    <p>Earth (or, "the earth") is only planet presently known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many field of scientific research. Within the solar system, it is third nearest to the sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar region, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region.</p>
    <h3><u>3.  Atmosphere,Climate,and Weather</u></h3>
    <p>The atmosphere of the Earth servers as a key factor in sustaining the planetary ecosystem . The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by the planet's gravity. Dry <b><u>air consist of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, 1% argon </u></b>and other inert gases, <b>carbon dioxide,</b>etc;but air is also contain a variable amount of water vapour. the atmospheric pressure declines steadly with altitudes, and has a scale height of about <b>8 kilometers</b>at the Earth's surface: the height at which the atmospheric pressure has declined by a factor of <span><b>(a mathematical constant equal to 2.71...)</b></span> </p>
    <h3><u>4. Water on Earth</u></h3>
    <p><b>Water </b>is a chemical substance that is composed of hydrogen and oxygen and is vital for all lnown forms of life. In typical usage, <span>Water </span>refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, wateer vapour or steam.</p>
    <p><B>Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. On other water bodies, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquiifers and 0.001% in the air as vapour, clouds <span>(formed of solid and liquid water particles suspended in air). </span>and precipitation.</B></p>
    <h3><u>5. Ecosystem's</u> </h3>
    <p>Ecosystem are composed of a variety of <b>Abiotic </b>or  <b>Biotic </b>components that function in an interralated way. The structure and composotion is determined by various environment factors that are interrelated. Variation of these factors will initiate dynamic modification to the ecosystem. Some of the more important componentsz are: <b>soil, atmosphere, radiation from the sun, water,and living organisms..</b></p>
    <h4><u>Examples of Ecosystem</u></h4>

        <li>Urban</li>
        <li>Reef </li>
        <li>and are many examples of Ecosystem..</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><u>6. Life</u></h3>
    <p>Althought there is no universal agreement on the defination of life, scientists generally accept that the biological manifestation of life is characterized by organization, metabolism, growth, adaptation, response to stimuli and reproduction. Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of organisms. From the brodest geophysiological point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system interagraping all living beings and their relationship, including their interaction with the element of the <b>lithosphere (rocks), hydrosphere(water), and atmosphere(air).</b> Currently the entire Earth contain over 75 billion tons <span><b>(150 trillion pounds or about 6.8x10x13 kilogram's) </b></span></p>
<h3><u>7. Human interrelationship </u></h3>
<p>Althought humans currently comprise only a minuscule proportion of the total living biomass on Earth, the human effect on nature is disproportionately large. Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and <b>"made environment" </b>is not clear cut except at the extreams. Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influenence is presently diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace. </p>
<h3><u>Note: </u></h3><b>"In the 13th century, the song Dynasty artist Shi Erji listed "scenes lacking any places made inaccessible by nature," as one of the 12 thing to avoid in painting. </b>
<h3><u>8. Matter and Energy </u></h3>
<p>Some fiedls of science see nature as matter in motion, obeying certain laws of nature which science seeks to understand. For this reason the most fundamental science is generally understood to be "physics"- the name for which is still recongnizable as meaning that it is the study of nature. Matter is commenly defined as the substance of which physical objects are composed. It constitutes the observable universe. The visible components of the universe are now believed to compose only <b>4% </b>of the total mass. The remainder is believed to consist of <b>23% </b>cold dark matter </p>
<H3><U>9. Beyond Earth</U></H3>
<p><b>Outer space, </b>also simply called <span><b>space, </b></span>refers to the relatively empty region of celestial bodies. Outer space is used to distinguis it from airspace <b>(and terrestrial locations). </b>There is no discrete boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude. Outer space within the solar system is called interplanetary space, which passes over into interstellar space at what is known as the helipause. Condition on the other terrestrial planets, Mercury and Venus, appear to be too harsh to support life as we know it. But it has been conjectured that Eoropa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life. </p>
